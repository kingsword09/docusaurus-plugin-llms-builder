# Docusaurus LLMs Builder Plugin

Welcome to the Docusaurus LLMs Builder Plugin! This powerful tool helps you integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into
your Docusaurus documentation by processing your content and preparing it for LLM consumption. This can enable dynamic
content generation, automated documentation updates, enhanced user interactions, and more.

Whether you're looking to build a question-answering system based on your docs, generate summaries, or perform other
LLM-driven tasks, this plugin provides the foundation by structuring and consolidating your Docusaurus content.

## Get Started Quickly

- **[Installation](./getting-started/installation.md)**: Add the plugin to your Docusaurus project.
- **[Basic Configuration](./getting-started/configuration.md)**: Learn how to set up the plugin in your
  `docusaurus.config.js`.

## Dive Deeper

- **[Basic Usage Guide](./guides/basic-usage.md)**: Follow a step-by-step guide for a common use case.
- **[Plugin Options (API Reference)](./api/plugin-options.md)**: Explore all the available configuration options to
  tailor the plugin to your specific needs.

## Key Features

- **Content Aggregation**: Gathers content from your Docusaurus `docs` and `blog` sections.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Use glob patterns to include/exclude files and define processing order.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Generate summarized (`llms.txt`) and potentially full-text (`llms_full.txt`) versions of
  your content.
- **Extensible**: Configure multiple instances for different parts of your site or different LLM tasks.
- **Link Inclusion**: Add relevant external links to your LLM-processed content using the `extraSession` feature.

We hope this plugin helps you unlock new possibilities with LLMs and your Docusaurus site!
